# Increase shared_buffers to allocate more memory for database caching
shared_buffers = 2GB  # Adjust based on available memory

# Adjust work_mem for per-operation memory allocation (e.g., sorting, hashing)
work_mem = 128MB  # Increase if performing large object operations

# Increase maintenance_work_mem for maintenance operations (e.g., vacuum, index creation)
maintenance_work_mem = 1GB  # Adjust as needed for large object maintenance

# If using Large Objects (LOBs), adjust lo_buffers and lo_mem_size
lo_buffers = 8MB  # Buffer size for Large Objects
lo_mem_size = 32MB  # Maximum size for in-memory Large Objects

# Adjust effective_cache_size based on available system memory for query planning
effective_cache_size = 4GB  # Represents the assumed size of the disk cache

# Additionally, consider other parameters related to performance tuning and resource allocation
